AI-Powered Flappy Bird Game

Welcome to the AI-powered Flappy Bird game! This game is implemented using Pygame for the graphical interface and the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to train the AI to play the game.
Overview

This project combines classic arcade gameplay with modern AI techniques. The core game is Flappy Bird, a popular game where the player controls a bird trying to navigate through pipes without hitting them. Instead of human input, this version uses AI to control the bird, trained using NEAT to improve its performance over time.
Features

    Pygame Implementation: The game interface, including graphics and controls, is created using Pygame.
    NEAT Algorithm: Utilizes NEAT to evolve neural networks that learn to play the game.
    AI Training: The AI learns through evolution, adapting its neural network to improve its performance.
    Customizable Parameters: Allows adjustments to the NEAT algorithm settings and game parameters
